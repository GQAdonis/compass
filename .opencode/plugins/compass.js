// IMPORTANT: keep the reminder string free of backticks and $(...) constructs.
// The hook prepends `echo "<reminder>" && <cmd>` to the user's bash command;
// backticks inside the double-quoted echo trigger bash command substitution,
// which both corrupts tool output and silently executes the very compass
// command we are only suggesting. Plain words render fine in opencode's TUI.
